# Contributing to this module

I am always happy to consider contributions to the code offered here. Please feel free to raise issues or pull requests. If a feature was useful enough for you to add then it may be useful to others!

I generally try to avoid breaking changes and changes to default behaviour except e.g. where versions have become deprecated. New options that don't change default behaviour are welcome.

All proposed code changes must be tested before submission! I don't have a formal test suite so I'm afraid it is a case of testing changes manually with deployment, log in successfully, etc. 

Thanks
